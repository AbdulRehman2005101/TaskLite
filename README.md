# JSON Todo with Custom Reconciler

## Project Overview

This project is a minimal Todo application that focuses on learning and implementing key concepts manually.

Instead of using React or other frameworks, I attempted to mimic the core idea behind Reactâ€™s rendering mechanism by building a custom reconciler from scratch. This helped me understand how diffing and UI updates work at a lower level.
